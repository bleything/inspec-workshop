Infrastructure and Compliance Testing with Chef InSpec
================================================================================

This repository contains the support materials for Ben Bleything's [InSpec]
workshop. It's probably not very interesting if you're not participating in the
workshop, but don't let that stop you from poking around.

If you _are_ participating in the workshop, great! Welcome! Here's the giant
"Open in Cloud Shell" button I mention during the intro. You should click it!
